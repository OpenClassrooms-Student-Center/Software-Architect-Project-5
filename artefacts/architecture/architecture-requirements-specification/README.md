# Purpose of this Document

*The Architecture Requirements Specification provides a set of quantitative statements that outline what an implementation project must do in order to comply with the architecture. An Architecture Requirements Specification will typically form a major component of an implementation contract or contract for more detailed Architecture Definition.
As mentioned above, the Architecture Requirements Specification is a companion to the Architecture Definition Document, with a complementary objective:
The Architecture Definition Document provides a qualitative view of the solution and aims to communicate the intent of the architect.
The Architecture Requirements Specification provides a quantitative view of the solution, stating measurable criteria that must be met during the implementation of the architecture.*
