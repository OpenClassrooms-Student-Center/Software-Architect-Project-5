# Purpose of this Document
_Architecture Contracts are the joint agreements between development partners and sponsors on the deliverables, quality, and fitness-for-purpose of an architecture. Successful implementation of these agreements will be delivered through effective architecture governance (see TOGAF Part VII, Architecture Governance). By implementing a governed approach to the management of contracts, the following will be ensured:_

* A system of continuous monitoring to check integrity, changes, decision-making, and audit of all architecture-related activities within the organization
* Adherence to the principles, standards, and requirements of the existing or developing architectures
• Identification of risks in all aspects of the development and implementation of the architecture(s) covering the internal development against accepted standards, policies, technologies, and products as well as the operational aspects of the architectures such that the organization can continue its business within a resilient environment
    * _A set of processes and practices that ensure accountability, responsibility, and discipline with regard to the development and usage of all architectural artifacts_
    * _A formal understanding of the governance organization responsible for the contract, their level of authority, and scope of the architecture under the governance of this body_

_This is a signed statement of intent on designing and developing the enterprise architecture, or significant parts of it, from partner organizations, including systems integrators, applications providers, and service providers._

_Increasingly, the development of one or more architecture domains (business, data, application, technology) may be contracted out, with the enterprise's architecture function providing oversight of the overall enterprise architecture, and co-ordination and control of the overall effort. In some cases even this oversight role may be contracted out, although most enterprises prefer to retain that core responsibility in-house._

_Whatever the specifics of the contracting-out arrangements, the arrangements themselves will normally be governed by an Architecture Contract that defines the deliverables, quality, and fitness-for-purpose of the developed architecture, and the processes by which the partners in the architecture development will work together._
